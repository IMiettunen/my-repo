# Project readme

Most of the components in the project do not yet interact with one another.

For the current implementation of the main_window user interface, pyqt5 is required
"pip install pyqt5" in the python console to install it.

Implementations of graphs.py and apirequests.py are still in progress and they do not serve a purpose yet.
They require at least the libraries matplotlib, numpy and requests to function.
All of these can be installed with pip in the python console by stating "pip install x" with x being the corresponding library.
